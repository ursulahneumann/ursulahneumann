Hi and welcome! 👋 I received my PhD in Cell and Developmental Biology at the University of British Columbia researching diabetes. Currently I work as a Senior Scientist @ [Pawsperity Biotechnologies](https://pawsperitybio.ca/), an early stage start-up working on improving animal health through biomarker discovery 😺.

I am an RStats and Python user and am always looking to learn something new 📊.  In my free time I love to explore Vancouver’s trails ⛰️, practice yoga, and take pictures of flowers @bloomvancouver.
